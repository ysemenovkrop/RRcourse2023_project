The topic of the original research is: "The impact of confidence on the US housing bubble‚Äù. 

In said research, a Vector autoregressive model (VAR) is used to check how the confidence, other macroeconomic variables and their 
lags influence Housing Price Index (HPI) before the global financial crisis of 2008. 

Scope for reproduction (From E-Views to R) :

  1.  Inverse Roots of AR Characteristic Polynomial,

  2.  Correlation between model variables,

  4.  Choosing the best VAR model,

  5.  Granger causality tests,

  6.  Impulse response analysis,

Scope for improving/expanding the initial research:
  
  1.  Cointegration between variables,
  
  2.  Forecast error variance decomposition.
